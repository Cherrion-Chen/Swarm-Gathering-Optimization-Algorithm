The optimization functions are written in sgo.py, based on Numpy.

swarm_gathering(cost:function, cen:np.ndarray, ran:np.ndarray, swarm_size=32, epochs=128)->np.ndarray
momentum_swarm_gathering(cost:function, cen:np.ndarray, ran:np.ndarray, gamma=0.1, swarm_size=32, epochs=128)->np.ndarray

You can also use setup.py to generate .pyd files to further enhance the performance.

A C-language-version is also available in the C Header File "swarm.h", with which you may achieve higher performance.
